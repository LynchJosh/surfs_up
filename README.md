# surfs_up

##  Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project was to gather weather data in Hawaii to see if a surf shop could remain open all year round. June and December were selected to measure the temperatures of the summer highs and the winter lows.    

##  Results
.describe() was used to display the max, min, mean, and standard deviation for June and December.

- June has a mean of 74.94 a max of 85.00 and a min of 64.00

##  Summary
Gathering data on temperature is a great place to start however adding more weather data could yield better results. Adding rain data for June and December could help find a pattern in the dry and wet seasons. Humidity could be another query that could help determine the best place for the shop to be located.
